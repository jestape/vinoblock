Vinoblock is a set of packages built for the project Costaflores Global Vineyard.
The idea behind Costaflores Global Vineyard project is to create a hardware ethereum node that connects to the Openvino private network giving the end-user (basically wine cellars, restaurants, hotels...) the oportunity to:

* Check and secure that the Openvino private network information is not altered by checking the ethereum blockchain as a soft-node. Assuring the quality of the wine they are selling/serving.

* Monitor and audit the conditions in which their wines are being treated in the cellar. For now just temperature and humidity but the quantity of data to be collected and audited via blockchain will increase.

* Have a user-friendly interface and an eye-catching physical node to explain clients where the price difference between their products and 'supermarket' ones comes from. [Spoiler Alarm: Quality standards]. 

There's a step by step tutorial on how to implement your own vinoblock:

* [Raspberry pi initialisation.](http://wiki.costaflores.com/display/OP/Vinoblock)
* [Running the services.](http://wiki.costaflores.com/display/OP/The+Vinoblock)

I also encourage you to read about the [Openvino project](http://wiki.costaflores.com). Name a better way to learn blockchain than wine. I'll wait...
